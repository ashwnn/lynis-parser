# Lynis Analyzer (Next.js)

This project is a port of the single-file Lynis report analyzer into a Next.js application.

Features:
- Parse Lynis `.dat` reports and extract warnings & suggestions.
- Display structured recommendations with collapsible sections.
- AI-assisted analysis via Gemini (client-side, using a user-provided API key entered in the Analyzer UI).
- Download parsed output as JSON.
